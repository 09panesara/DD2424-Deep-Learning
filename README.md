# DD2424-Deep-Learning
Labs for KTH DD2424 Spring 2020 course, Deep Learning in Data Science. 
Assigments 1-3 are carried out on the CIFAR-10 Dataset for Image classification, and Assignment 4 is carried out on a piece of text from Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.

## Lab 1
One-layer network trained using mini-batch gradient descent. 

## Lab 2
2-layer network on Cifar-10, cyclic learning rates.

## Lab 3
K-layer network + Batch normalisation.

## Lab 4
Recurrent Neural Networks on Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.
